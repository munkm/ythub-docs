   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to yt Hub's documentation!
==================================

The yt Hub is an environment where data can be published, analyzed and shared
with other people. For instance, one can upload dataset using public curldrop
instance or girder data management system and then access it in Jupyter
Notebook. Over time, more services will be added and integrated.

.. note::
   Due to technical limitations, such as the requirement of user being
   identifiable by NCSA's LDAP, some services are only available to memebers of
   DXL group memebers and their collaborators. If you would like to gain access,
   please contact Matthew Turk.
